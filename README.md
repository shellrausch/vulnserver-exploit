# Exploit for [vulnserver](https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/vulnserver)

The `TRUN` command is vulnerable for a stackoverflow, which leads to remote code execution by overwritting the instruction pointer `EIP`. 

It contains three modes of operation: `fuzz`, `excludebadchars` and `exploit`. Every mode was used for a successful exploit development.
